USE OF OUTSIDE CODE:
The only files that contain external code are "footer.ejs", "navbar.ejs" and "contactForm.ejs".
For those files, most of the code comes from Bootstrap, although it has been heavily modified tho
suit my needs, eg. the contactForm has had modified to actually record and send the information
gathered to my email address, thus adding functionality. The navbar has been modified to display
all my website pages, and allows for you to click each page title to go there. the footer has
been modified to have my github and linkedin pages linked, and copyright information displayed

BOOTSTRAP AND FONTAWESOME:
I used bootstrap for the navbar, contact page, and footer. I used font awesome on the navbar by
displaying icons for each page.
